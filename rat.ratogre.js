 * Rat Ogre behavior — the monstrous brutes of the Skaven horde.
 * Massive, barely controlled killing machines. Not smart. Very stabby.
 * A single Rat Ogre can tear through a cluster of enemy creeps with ease.
 *
 * Intended role: heavy assault, structure demolition, shock and awe.
 * Body: massive TOUGH and ATTACK, minimal MOVE (slow but unstoppable).
 *
 * @TODO implement

  //   - No retreat — Rat Ogres don't know how to run
