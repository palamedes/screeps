# Screeps - Skaven

Skitter-skitter, hear-hear! The Skaven have entered the Screeps universe, and we will rule-rule with a mighty claw-paw! The Screeps shall learn-know the power of the Skaven, for we are the mighty-strongest and most smart-cunning race in all the realms.

With the guidance of the Great Grey Seer Thanquol and the blessing of the Great Horned Rat, we have secured our future with powerful brain-codes that make us unbeatable-unbeatable! We will take-seize everything we set our eyes on, and our enemies shall cringe-cringe in terror at the might of the Skaven Empire.

No one will stand-stand against us, for we are the Skaven! Our armies will swarm-swarm over the Screeps like a horde of rats, leaving nothing behind but the destruction of our foes. Tremble-tremble, for the Skaven Empire has come to claim-take its rightful place as the leader-rulers of this universe!

### In all seriousness

This is a place for me to learn how to play screeps and I thought it would be amusing to do so as my favorite Warhammer Fantasy race; The Skaven.  Know-fear us!
